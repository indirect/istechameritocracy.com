<p>My first piece of advice is to stop thinking about yourself as a meritocracy.

<p>&ldquo;The <em>intent</em> to be meritocratic is not a myth, but we know what road is paved with good intentions. â€¦ Itâ€™s time to apply our heartfelt belief that as engineers we are rational, and rationally accept what the data is telling us: it isnâ€™t a meritocracy. We are all biased.&rdquo;

<p>&ldquo;This mythology â€¦ denies the role of personal connections, wealth, background, gender, race, or education in an individualâ€™s success.&rdquo;

<p>Technology, as a field, is &ldquo;a make-believe cult of objective meritocracy, a pseudo-scientific mythos to obscure and reinforce the belief that only people who look and talk like us are worth noticing&rdquo;.

<p>&ldquo;Meritocracy presumes that everyone starts off and continues through with the same level of access to opportunity, time, and money, which is unfortunately not the case. â€¦</p>

<p>People who are contributing their unpaid and underpaid labor are investing their time into companies that are profiting greatly and giving little back in terms of financial support. â€¦</p>

<p>Businesses are choosing candidates based on their open source contributions, knowing that they are getting more value for less money out of them. â€¦</p>

<p>This is akin to not paying someone for overtime.&rdquo;</p>
